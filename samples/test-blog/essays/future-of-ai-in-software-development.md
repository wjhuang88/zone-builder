# The Future of AI in Software Development

Artificial Intelligence is rapidly changing how we develop software. From automated code generation to intelligent debugging, AI tools are becoming integral to the development process.

## Automated Code Generation

Modern AI models can generate code snippets based on natural language descriptions. This is particularly useful for boilerplate code and common patterns.

## Intelligent Debugging

AI-powered debugging tools can analyze code and predict potential bugs before they occur, saving developers countless hours of troubleshooting.

## Code Review Assistance

AI can assist in code reviews by identifying potential issues and suggesting improvements based on best practices and common patterns.
